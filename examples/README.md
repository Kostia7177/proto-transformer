To add a new example create a new directory with Proto.hpp, Server.cpp and Client.cpp files. The things that are to be either at the server side or at the client side, place into ExampleFeatures.hpp and ExampleFeatures.cpp files.
No need to add anything to a ../Makefile - the new example will be found automaticaly.
